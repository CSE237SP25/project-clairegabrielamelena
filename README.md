What user stories were completed this iteration? 
-An admin can login and access a menu that allows them to see current customers and their bank accounts.

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
-Addressing login capabilities and user input bugs

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

Some user inputs are recognized on invalid and we are working to fix those.

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (please provide a script that users can run to launch your program)?

To run script:

chemod +x script.sh
./script.sh
