For each iteration you should answer the following:

What user stories were completed this iteration? 
-A user of this app can create a bank customer account/profile, and view and select menu items. 
These menu items include the ability to open an account, deposit or withdraw money from an account


What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
-Eventually, we plan to implement bank admin features with a separate admin menu. These could include features like a bank admin can close accounts or merge accounts for a bank customer.
-We also might add features like a bank customer can transfer money between accounts, a bank customer can close an account.

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (please provide a script that users can run to launch your program)?
